# ### Machine Learning prediction model
# In this notebook we develop a ML model to predict two key values that are functional to our web application:  
#   
# **number of available bikes for a selected station  
# number of available bike stands for a selected station**  
#   
# The model is trained on data fetched from an Amazon RDS database, where we store historical data referring to:
#   
# real-time information that Dublin Bikes makes available through their web API  
# Dublin weather information from OpenWeather, obtained by a web API  
# ***N.B.:*** all database data are kept up-to-date.

# ### Getting started
# First of all, we need to import Python packages that are required to our model, as well as fetching the data from the Amazon RDS database.

# #### Import required packages
# A number of Python packages are required for our model in order to work, so we import them in our Notebook.

# #### Connect to Amazon RDS database
# After having stored all the necessary credentials in specific variables, we connect to the database providing error-handling in case of connection issues.

# #### Data fetching
# Bikes information
# We store real-time data from Dublin Bikes in a relation named "availability" in the RDS database schema.  
# We store weather data from OpenWeather in a relation named "weather" in the RDS database schema.
#   
# We fetch Pandas dataframe object and we examine it.
# 
# ***N.B.:***We started scrapping the bikes data on 02/03/2020

# Create dataframe and store data running SQL query

# ### Dummy coding(categorical -> continuous)

# We need to incorporate the following information (variables) in our model, but they are not immediately usable as they come in a categorical form:  
# **cloud coverage  
# day of the week**  
# Thus, we transform them in a series of dummy variables. The process is known as "dummy coding".

# In[ ]:


# Create a separate dataframe with days of the week (categorical)
data_input1 = pd.DataFrame(df_AllStations['weekday'])

# Create a separate dataframe with cloud coverage information (categorical)
data_input2 = pd.DataFrame(df_AllStations['weatherMain'])

# Concatenate the two dataframes in the main one
dummy = pd.get_dummies(data_input1)
dummy_2 = pd.get_dummies(data_input2)
df_AllStations = pd.concat([df_AllStations,dummy],axis=1)
df_AllStations = pd.concat([df_AllStations,dummy_2],axis=1)


# In[ ]:


## Examine dataframe object, show first rows
df_AllStations.head()


# ### Check dataframe state

# #### New columns
# The new dummy coded variables have been concatenated at the end of the dataframe, so we now check our dataframe shape.

# In[ ]:


# Show number of rows and columns of the dataframe
print("The dataset has %s rows and %s columns." % df_AllStations.shape)


# #### Data types
# As a further check, we analyze the data type in our dataframe.

# ### ML model
# In order to predict our two target variables  
# 
# **number of available bikes  
# number of available bike stands**  
# we need two differnt ML models that are trained in the following section.  
# After having tested the regression model as a viable alternative, we decided to implement a *Random Forest* classifier model, as it proves to be a more effective predictor.
#   
#  ***N.B.:*** we train our models on a random selection of 2/3 of the original dataset. We perform testing on the remain
